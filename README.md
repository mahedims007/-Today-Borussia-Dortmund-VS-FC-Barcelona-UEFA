#  ⚽️Today-Borussia-Dortmund-VS-FC-Barcelona-UEFA⚽️ 

April 14th, 2025 ⚽️ Today Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona should have already faced off in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League Quarter Final matchup. [[Image: European Super Cup 2025.png|900px|thumb|centre|The game took place on 9 April 2025 at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Barcelona, with Barcelona winning decisively against Dortmund 0-4]] ​
The return match is on April 15, 2025, as well, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. That result gives Ajax a 4-0 aggregate lead over Dortmund, so to see them through we must go over that goal difference. ​
This week's developments, ahead of the second leg:
Injuries: Borussia Dortmund’s central defender Nico Schlotterbeck is out for the season with torn meniscus, leaving a significant hole in Borussia’s back line. Balde, who made the left side of Barcelona's defence his own this season, suffered a hamstring problem that could keep him away for around three weeks, which could in turn make him miss the Champions League tie, among other fixtures. ​
Suspension watch: Barça’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away from a ban that would keep him out of the semi-finals. This disciplinary problem may have an effect on his playing time next match. ​
Match Details:
When: April 15, 2025, at 9:00 PM CET (12:00 PM PT, 3:00 PM ET) ​
Where: Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund, Germany. ​
TV: In the United States, the game is available on CBS Sports Network and streaming on Paramount+. In Spain, DAZN will have it. Bangladesh: Expected on local broadcasters or streaming platforms; consult local listings. ​
Dortmund are sitting on the aggregate in their favour, making it all but impossible for them to be knocked out by Barcelona. Dortmund, however, will be keen to avenge the 3-0 whitewashing with supporters all over the globe waiting to see if the hosts can do it all over again or if it will be Barcelona joining Cornellà in the last four.
Team Form
Barcelona: Unbeaten in 2025 in all competitions, with 19 wins and four draws. Now, they sit atop La Liga and are favorites to win the Champions League.
Borussia Dortmund: Slumping at home, in eighth place in the Bundesliga. They salvaged a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich at the weekend, but have ground to make up in Europe.
Probable Lineups
Borussia Dortmund:
Kobel; Ryerson, Can, Anton, Bensebaini; Gross, Nmecha; Gittens, Brandt, Adeyemi; Guirassy
Barcelona:
Szczesny; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Martin; Pedri, De Jong; Yamal, Lopez, Raphinha; Lewandowski.
Key Stats
Barcelona have never lost in six UEFA competition meetings with Borussia Dortmund (W4 D2).
Robert Lewandowski (14) is the player aged 35+ to have scored the most goals in the Champions League.
Before his 18th birthday, Lamine Yamal becomes the youngest footballer in history to score four goals in Champions League
Match Outlook
Dortmund will have to move mountains to cross the line. A first-half goal would swing the momentum in their favour, although it will be tough to crack a solid Barcelona defence. Barcelona, however, should be able to rotate their squad fucking heavily and at the same time adhere to the same light & tight pressing and light & heavy attack system that took them here to easily secure passage to the semi finals.
Predictions
With Barcelona’s form and aggregate lead:
Most Likely Result: Barcelona win or draw
Betting Tips: Barcelona -1 handicap or both to score yes
